# independent_station
This repository contains a minimal local scaffold for an independent e-commerce store (frontend + backend).

Quick start (two terminals):

```bash
# 1) Start backend
cd backend
npm install
node index.js

# 2) Start frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- Backend uses JSON files under `backend/data/` (no DB yet) so you can iterate quickly.
- KNET integration is mocked in the backend; real KNET requires merchant credentials and server-side integration.

See `backend/README.md` and `frontend/README.md` for more details.
